An clinical-academic lab group based between UCLH and UCL’s Institute of Health Informatics.

Our clinical focus starts with critical care but we have active collaborations with anaesthesia, peri-operative medicine, global health, and acute medicine.

We’ve been working on translational data science for health since 2015.
