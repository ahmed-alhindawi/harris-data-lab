abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To build and curate a linkable multi-centre database of high
  resolution longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) from adult Intensive Care
  Units (ICU). To develop a set of open-source tools to make these data ‘research
  ready’ while protecting patient’s privacy with a particular focus on anonymisation.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a scalable EHR processing pipeline for extracting,
  linking, normalising and curating and anonymising EHR data. Patient and public involvement
  was sought from the outset, and approval to hold these data was granted by the NHS
  Health Research Authority’s Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG). The data are held
  in a certified Data Safe Haven. We followed sustainable software development principles
  throughout, and defined and populated a common data model that links to other clinical
  areas. RESULTS: Longitudinal EHR data were loaded into the CCHIC database from eleven
  adult ICUs at 5 UK teaching hospitals. From January 2014 to January 2017, this amounted
  to 21,930 and admissions (18,074 unique patients). Typical admissions have 70 data-items
  pertaining to admission and discharge, and a median of 1030 (IQR 481-2335) time-varying
  measures. Training datasets were made available through virtual machine images emulating
  the data processing environment. An open source R package, cleanEHR, was developed
  and released that transforms the data into a square table readily analysable by
  most statistical packages. A simple language agnostic configuration file will allow
  the user to select and clean variables, and impute missing data. An audit trail
  makes clear the provenance of the data at all times. DISCUSSION: Making health care
  data available for research is problematic. CCHIC is a unique multi-centre longitudinal
  and linkable resource that prioritises patient privacy through the highest standards
  of data security, but also provides tools to clean, organise, and anonymise the
  data. We believe the development of such tools are essential if we are to meet the
  twin requirements of respecting patient privacy and working for patient benefit.
  CONCLUSION: The CCHIC database is now in use by health care researchers from academia
  and industry. The ‘research ready’ suite of data preparation tools have facilitated
  access, and linkage to national databases of secondary care is underway.'
