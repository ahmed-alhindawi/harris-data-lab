abstract: 'Postoperative critical care is a finite resource that is recommended for
  high-risk patients. Despite national recommendations specifying that such patients
  should receive postoperative critical care, there is evidence that these recommendations
  are not universally followed. We performed a national survey aiming to better understand
  how patients are risk-stratified in practice; elucidate clinicians’ opinions about
  how patients should be selected for critical care; and determine factors which affect
  the actual provision of postoperative critical care. As part of the second Sprint
  National Anaesthesia Project, epidemiology of critical care after surgery study,
  we distributed a paper survey to anaesthetists, surgeons and intensivists providing
  peri-operative care during a single week in March 2017. We collected data on respondent
  characteristics, and their opinions of postoperative critical care provision, potential
  benefits and real-world challenges. We undertook both quantitative and qualitative
  analyses to interpret the responses. We received 10,383 survey responses from 237
  hospitals across the UK. Consultants used a lower threshold for critical care admission
  than other career grades, indicating potentially more risk-averse behaviour. The
  majority of respondents reported that critical care provision was inadequate, and
  cited the value of critical care as being predominantly due to higher nurse: patient
  ratios. Use of objective risk assessment tools was poor, and patients were commonly
  selected for critical care based on procedure-specific pathways rather than individualised
  risk assessment. Challenges were highlighted in the delivery of peri-operative critical
  care services, such as an overall lack of capacity, competition for beds with non-surgical
  cases and poor flow through the hospital leading to bed ‘blockages’. Critical care
  is perceived to provide benefit to high-risk surgical patients, but there is variation
  in practice about the definition and determination of risk, how patients are referred
  and how to deal with the lack of critical care resources. Future work should focus
  on evaluating ‘enhanced care’ units for postoperative patients, how to better implement
  individualised risk assessment in practice, and how to improve patient flow through
  hospitals.'
