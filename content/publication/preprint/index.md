title: An Informatics Consult approach for generating clinical evidence for
  treatment decisions
abstract: "An Informatics Consult has been proposed in which clinicians request
  novel evidence from large scale health data resources, tailored to the
  treatment of a specific patient, with return of results in clinical
  timescales. However, the availability of such consultations is lacking. We
  seek to provide an Informatics Consult for a situation where a treatment
  indication and contraindication coexist in the same patient, i.e.,
  anti-coagulation use for stroke prevention in a patient with both atrial
  fibrillation (AF) and liver cirrhosis. We examined four sources of evidence
  for the effect of warfarin on stroke risk (efficacy) or all-cause mortality
  (safety) from: (i) randomised controlled trials (RCTs), (ii) meta- analysis of
  prior observational studies, (iii) trial emulation (using population
  electronic health records (N = 3,854,710) and (iv) genetic evidence (Mendelian
  randomisation). We developed prototype forms to request an Informatics Consult
  and return of results in electronic health record systems. We found 0 RCT
  reports and 0 trials recruiting for patients with AF and cirrhosis. We found
  broad concordance across the three new sources of evidence we generated.
  Meta-analysis of prior observational studies showed that warfarin use was
  associated with lower stroke risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71). In a target
  trial emulation, warfarin was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR =
  0.61) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 0.27). Mendelian randomisation served as a
  drug target validation where we found that lower levels of vitamin K1
  (warfarin is a vitamin K1 antagonist) are associated with lower stroke risk. A
  pilot survey with an independent sample of 34 clinicians revealed that 85% of
  clinicians found information on prognosis useful and that 79% thought that
  they should have access to the Informatics Consult as a service within their
  healthcare systems. We identified candidate steps for automation to scale
  evidence generation and to accelerate the return of results within clinical
  timescales."
