abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of melarsoprol and eflornithine
  in treating late-stage Gambian trypanosomiasis in the Republic of the Congo. METHODS:
  We analysed the outcomes of death during treatment and relapse within 1 year of
  discharge for 288 patients treated with eflornithine, 311 patients treated with
  the standard melarsoprol regimen and 62 patients treated with a short-course (10-day)
  melarsoprol regimen between April 2001 and April 2005. FINDINGS: A total of 1.7%
  (5/288) of patients treated with eflornithine died compared with 4.8% (15/311) of
  those treated with standard melarsoprol and 6.5% (4/62) of those treated with short-course
  melarsoprol. Patients treated with eflornithine tended to be younger and were more
  likely to have trypanosomes or higher white blood cell counts in their cerebrospinal
  fluid. The cumulated incidence of relapse among patients who attended at least one
  follow-up visit 1 year after discharge was 8.1% (11/136) for those treated with
  eflornithine, 14% (36/258) for those treated with standard melarsoprol and 15.5%
  (9/58) for those treated with shortcourse melarsoprol. In a multivariate analysis,
  when compared with eflornithine, standard melarsoprol was found to be a risk factor
  for both death (odds ratio (OR) = 2.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-8.00)
  and relapse (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.47; 95% CI = 1.22-5.03); when compared with eflornithine,
  short-course melarsoprol was also found to be a risk factor for death (OR = 3.90;
  95% CI = 1.02-14.98) and relapse (HR = 6.65; 95% CI = 2.61-16.94). CONCLUSION: The
  effectiveness of melarsoprol treatment appears to have diminished. Eflornithine
  seems to be a better first-line therapy for treating late-stage Gambian trypanosomiasis
  in the Republic of the Congo.'
