abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Perioperative infection and sepsis are of fundamental concern
  to perioperative clinicians. However, standardised endpoints are either poorly defined
  or not routinely implemented. The Standardised Endpoints in Perioperative Medicine
  (StEP) initiative was established to derive a set of standardised endpoints for
  use in perioperative clinical trials. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review
  to identify measures of infection and sepsis used in the perioperative literature.
  A multi-round Delphi consensus process that included more than 60 clinician researchers
  was then used to refine a recommended list of outcome measures. RESULTS: A literature
  search yielded 1857 titles of which 255 met inclusion criteria for endpoint extraction.
  A long list of endpoints, with definitions and timescales, was generated and those
  potentially relevant to infection and sepsis circulated to the theme subgroup and
  then the wider StEP-COMPAC working group, undergoing a three-stage Delphi process.
  The response rates for Delphi rounds 1, 3, and 3 were 89% (n=8), 67% (n=62), and
  80% (n=8), respectively. A set of 13 endpoints including fever, surgical site, and
  organ-specific infections as defined by the US Centres for Disease Control and Sepsis-3
  are proposed for future use. CONCLUSIONS: We defined a consensus list of standardised
  endpoints related to infection and sepsis for perioperative trials using an established
  and rigorous approach. Each endpoint was evaluated with respect to validity, reliability,
  feasibility, and patient centredness. One or more of these should be considered
  for inclusion in future perioperative clinical trials assessing infection, sepsis,
  or both, thereby permitting synthesis and comparison of future results.'
