abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse
  lung damage. Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and
  thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death. METHODS: In this controlled,
  open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized
  with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone
  (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.
  The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Here, we report the preliminary results
  of this comparison. RESULTS: A total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone
  and 4321 to receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone
  group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after
  randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75
  to 0.93; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality
  varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients
  were receiving at the time of randomization. In the dexamethasone group, the incidence
  of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive
  mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81)
  and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3%
  vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were
  receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio,
  1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55). CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with Covid-19,
  the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were
  receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization
  but not among those receiving no respiratory support. (Funded by the Medical Research
