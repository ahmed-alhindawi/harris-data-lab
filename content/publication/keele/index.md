abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Instrumental variable (IV) analysis can estimate treatment
  effects in the presence of residual or unmeasured confounding. In settings wherein
  measures of baseline risk severity are unavailable, IV designs are, therefore, particularly
  appealing, but, where established measures of risk severity are available, it is
  unclear whether IV methods are preferable. OBJECTIVE: We compared regression with
  an IV design to estimate the effect of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer on mortality
  in a study with well-established measures of risk severity. RESEARCH DESIGN: We
  use ICU bed availability at the time of assessment for ICU transfer as an instrument.
  Bed availability increases the chance of ICU admission, contains little information
  about patient characteristics, and it is unlikely that bed availability has any
  direct effect on in-hospital mortality. SUBJECTS: We used a cohort study of deteriorating
  ward patients assessed for critical care unit admission, in 49 UK National Health
  Service hospitals between November 1, 2010, and December 31, 2011. MEASURES: Detailed
  demographic, physiological, and comorbidity data were collected for all patients.
  RESULTS: The risk adjustment methods reported that, after controlling for all measured
  covariates including measures of risk severity, ICU transfer was associated with
  higher 28-day mortality, with a risk difference of 7.2% (95% confidence interval=5.3%-9.1%).
  The IV estimate of ICU transfer was -5.4% (95% confidence interval=-47.1% to 36.3%)
  and applies to the subsample of patients whose transfer was “encouraged” by bed
  availability. CONCLUSIONS: IV estimates indicate that ICU care is beneficial but
  are imprecisely estimated. Risk-adjusted estimates are more precise but, even with
  a rich set of covariates, report that ICU care is harmful.'
