abstract: 'PURPOSE: Septic shock is associated with massive release of endogenous
  catecholamines. Adrenergic agents may exacerbate catecholamine toxicity and contribute
  to poor outcomes. We sought to determine whether an association existed between
  tachycardia and mortality in septic shock patients requiring norepinephrine for
  more than 6 h despite adequate volume resuscitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multicentre
  retrospective observational study on 730 adult patients in septic shock consecutively
  admitted to eight European ICUs between 2011 and 2013. Three timepoints were selected:
  T1 (first hour of infusion of norepinephrine), Tpeak (time of highest dose during
  the first 24 h of treatment), and T24 (24-h post-T1). Binary logistic regression
  models were constructed for the three time-points. RESULTS: Overall ICU mortality
  was 38.4%. Mortality was higher in those requiring high-dose (≥0.3 mcg/kg/min) versus
  low-dose (<0.3 mcg/kg/min) norepinephrine at T1 (53.4% vs 30.6%; p < 0.001) and
  T24 (61.4% vs 20.4%; p < 0.0001). Patients requiring high-dose with concurrent tachycardia
  had higher mortality at T1; in the low-dose group tachycardia was not associated
  with mortality. Resolving tachycardia (from T1 to T24) was associated with lower
  mortality compared to patients where tachycardia persisted (27.8% vs 46.4%; p = 0.001).
  CONCLUSIONS: Use of high-dose norepinephrine and concurrent tachycardia are associated
  with poor outcomes in septic shock.'
