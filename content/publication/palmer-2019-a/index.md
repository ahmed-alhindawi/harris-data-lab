abstract: <b>Rationale:</b> There is conflicting evidence on harm related to exposure
  to supraphysiologic Pa|O|2|| (hyperoxemia) in critically ill patients.<b>Objectives:</b>
  To examine the association between longitudinal exposure to hyperoxemia and mortality
  in patients admitted to ICUs in five United Kingdom university hospitals.<b>Methods:</b>
  A retrospective cohort of ICU admissions between January 31, 2014, and December
  31, 2018, from the National Institute of Health Research Critical Care Health Informatics
  Collaborative was studied. Multivariable logistic regression modeled death in ICU
  by exposure to hyperoxemia.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Subsets with oxygen
  exposure windows of 0 to 1, 0 to 3, 0 to 5, and 0 to 7 days were evaluated, capturing
  19,515, 10,525, 6,360, and 4,296 patients, respectively. Hyperoxemia dose was defined
  as the area between the Pa|O|2|| time curve and a boundary of 13.3 kPa (100 mm Hg)
  divided by the hours of potential exposure (24, 72, 120, or 168 h). An association
  was found between exposure to hyperoxemia and ICU mortality for exposure windows
  of 0 to 1 days (odds ratio [OR], 1.15; 95% compatibility interval [CI], 0.95-1.38;
  P = 0.15), 0 to 3 days (OR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04-1.74; P = 0.02), 0 to 5 days (OR,
  1.5; 95% CI, 1.07-2.13; P = 0.02), and 0 to 7 days (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.11-2.72;
  P = 0.02). However, a dose-response relationship was not observed. There was no
  evidence to support a differential effect between hyperoxemia and either a respiratory
  diagnosis or mechanical ventilation.<b>Conclusions:</b> An association between hyperoxemia
  and mortality was observed in our large, unselected multicenter cohort. The absence
  of a dose-response relationship weakens causal interpretation. Further experimental
  research is warranted to elucidate this important question.
