abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) is associated strongly
  with increased cardiac ischaemic risk and perioperative death. Associations with
  non-cardiac morbidity in non-cardiac surgery have not been explored. In the elective
  orthopaedic surgical population, morbidity is common but preoperative predictors
  are unclear. We hypothesized that RCRI would identify individuals at increased risk
  of non-cardiac morbidity in this surgically homogenous population. METHODS: Five
  hundred and sixty patients undergoing elective primary (>90%) and revision hip and
  knee procedures were studied. A modified RCRI (mRCRI) score was calculated, weighting
  intermediate and low risk factors. The primary endpoint was the development of morbidity,
  collected prospectively using the Postoperative Morbidity Survey, on postoperative
  day (POD) 5. RESULTS: Morbidity on POD 5 was more frequent in patients with mRCRI
  ≥ 3 relative risk 1.7, [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4-2.1]; P<0.001. Time to
  hospital discharge was delayed in patients with mRCRI score ≥ 3 (log-rank test,
  P=0.0002). Pulmonary (P<0.001), infectious (P=0.001), cardiovascular (P=0.0003),
  renal (P<0.0001), wound (P=0.02), and neurological (P=0.002) morbidities were more
  common in patients with mRCRI score ≥ 3. Pre/postoperative haematocrit, anaesthetic/analgesic
  technique, and postoperative temperature were similar across mRCRI groups. There
  were significant associations with hospital stay, as measured by the area under
  the receiver-operating characteristic curves for mRCRI 0.64 (95% CI: 0.58-0.70)
  and POSSUM 0.70 (95% CI: 0.63-0.75). CONCLUSIONS: mRCRI score ≥ 3 is associated
  with increased postoperative non-cardiac morbidity and prolonged hospital stay after
  elective orthopaedic procedures. mRCRI can contribute to objective risk stratification
  of postoperative morbidity.'
