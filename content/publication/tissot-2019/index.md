abstract: <jats:p>Clinical trials often fail on recruiting an adequate number of appropriate
  patients. Identifying eligible trial participants is a resource-intensive task when
  relying on manual review of clinical notes, particularly in critical care settings
  where the time window is short. Automated review of electronic health records has
  been explored as a way of identifying trial participants, but much of the information
  is in unstructured free text rather than a computable form. We developed an electronic
  health record pipeline that combines structured electronic health record data with
  free text in order to simulate recruitment into the LeoPARDS trial. We applied an
  algorithm to identify eligible patients using a moving 1-hour time window, and compared
  the set of patients identified by our approach with those actually screened and
  recruited for the trial. We manually reviewed clinical records for a random sample
  of additional patients identified by the algorithm but not identified for screening
  in the original trial. Our approach identified 308 patients, of whom 208 were screened
  in the actual trial. We identified all 40 patients with CCHIC data available who
  were actually recruited to LeoPARDS in our centre. The algorithm identified 96 patients
  on the same day as manual screening and 62 patients one or two days earlier. Analysis
  of electronic health records incorporating natural language processing tools could
  effectively replicate recruitment in a critical care trial, and identify some eligible
  patients at an earlier stage. If implemented in real-time this could improve the
  efficiency of clinical trial recruitment.</jats:p
