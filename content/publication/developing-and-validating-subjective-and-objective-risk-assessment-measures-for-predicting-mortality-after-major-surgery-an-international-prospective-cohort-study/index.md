abstract: "BACKGROUND:  Preoperative risk prediction is important for guiding
  clinical decision-making and resource allocation. Clinicians frequently rely
  solely on their own clinical judgement for risk prediction rather than
  objective measures. We aimed to compare the accuracy of freely available
  objective surgical risk tools with subjective clinical assessment in
  predicting 30-day mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS:  We conducted a prospective
  observational study in 274 hospitals in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia,
  and New Zealand. For 1 week in 2017, prospective risk, surgical, and outcome
  data were collected on all adults aged 18 years and over undergoing surgery
  requiring at least a 1-night stay in hospital. Recruitment bias was avoided
  through an ethical waiver to patient consent; a mixture of rural, urban,
  district, and university hospitals participated. We compared subjective
  assessment with 3 previously published, open-access objective risk tools for
  predicting 30-day mortality: the Portsmouth-Physiology and Operative Severity
  Score for the enUmeration of Mortality (P-POSSUM), Surgical Risk Scale (SRS),
  and Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (SORT). We then developed a logistic regression
  model combining subjective assessment and the best objective tool and compared
  its performance to each constituent method alone. We included 22,631 patients
  in the study: 52.8% were female, median age was 62 years (interquartile range
  [IQR] 46 to 73 years), median postoperative length of stay was 3 days (IQR 1
  to 6), and inpatient 30-day mortality was 1.4%. Clinicians used subjective
  assessment alone in 88.7% of cases. All methods overpredicted risk, but visual
  inspection of plots showed the SORT to have the best calibration. The SORT
  demonstrated the best discrimination of the objective tools (SORT Area Under
  Receiver Operating Characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.90, 95% confidence
  interval [CI]: 0.88-0.92; P-POSSUM = 0.89, 95% CI 0.88-0.91; SRS = 0.85, 95%
  CI 0.82-0.87). Subjective assessment demonstrated good discrimination (AUROC =
  0.89, 95% CI: 0.86-0.91) that was not different from the SORT (p = 0.309).
  Combining subjective assessment and the SORT improved discrimination
  (bootstrap optimism-corrected AUROC = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.90-0.94) and
  demonstrated continuous Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI = 0.13, 95% CI:
  0.06-0.20, p < 0.001) compared with subjective assessment alone.
  Decision-curve analysis (DCA) confirmed the superiority of the SORT over other
  previously published models, and the SORT-clinical judgement model again
  performed best overall. Our study is limited by the low mortality rate, by the
  lack of blinding in the 'subjective' risk assessments, and because we only
  compared the performance of clinical risk scores as opposed to other
  prediction tools such as exercise testing or frailty assessment.
  CONCLUSIONS:  In this study, we observed that the combination of subjective
  assessment with a parsimonious risk model improved perioperative risk
  estimation. This may be of value in helping clinicians allocate finite
  resources such as critical care and to support patient involvement in clinical
  decision-making."
