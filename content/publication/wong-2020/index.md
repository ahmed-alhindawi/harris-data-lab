abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Preoperative risk prediction is important for guiding clinical
  decision-making and resource allocation. Clinicians frequently rely solely on their
  own clinical judgement for risk prediction rather than objective measures. We aimed
  to compare the accuracy of freely available objective surgical risk tools with subjective
  clinical assessment in predicting 30-day mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted
  a prospective observational study in 274 hospitals in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia,
  and New Zealand. For 1 week in 2017, prospective risk, surgical, and outcome data
  were collected on all adults aged 18 years and over undergoing surgery requiring
  at least a 1-night stay in hospital. Recruitment bias was avoided through an ethical
  waiver to patient consent; a mixture of rural, urban, district, and university hospitals
  participated. We compared subjective assessment with 3 previously published, open-access
  objective risk tools for predicting 30-day mortality: the Portsmouth-Physiology
  and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality (P-POSSUM), Surgical
  Risk Scale (SRS), and Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (SORT). We then developed a logistic
  regression model combining subjective assessment and the best objective tool and
  compared its performance to each constituent method alone. We included 22,631 patients
  in the study: 52.8% were female, median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR]
  46 to 73 years), median postoperative length of stay was 3 days (IQR 1 to 6), and
  inpatient 30-day mortality was 1.4%. Clinicians used subjective assessment alone
  in 88.7% of cases. All methods overpredicted risk, but visual inspection of plots
  showed the SORT to have the best calibration. The SORT demonstrated the best discrimination
  of the objective tools (SORT Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
  [AUROC] = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-0.92; P-POSSUM = 0.89, 95% CI
  0.88-0.91; SRS = 0.85, 95% CI 0.82-0.87). Subjective assessment demonstrated good
  discrimination (AUROC = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.86-0.91) that was not different from the
  SORT (p = 0.309). Combining subjective assessment and the SORT improved discrimination
  (bootstrap optimism-corrected AUROC = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.90-0.94) and demonstrated
  continuous Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.06-0.20, p <
  0.001) compared with subjective assessment alone. Decision-curve analysis (DCA)
  confirmed the superiority of the SORT over other previously published models, and
  the SORT-clinical judgement model again performed best overall. Our study is limited
  by the low mortality rate, by the lack of blinding in the ‘subjective’ risk assessments,
  and because we only compared the performance of clinical risk scores as opposed
  to other prediction tools such as exercise testing or frailty assessment. CONCLUSIONS:
  In this study, we observed that the combination of subjective assessment with a
  parsimonious risk model improved perioperative risk estimation. This may be of value
  in helping clinicians allocate finite resources such as critical care and to support
  patient involvement in clinical decision-making.'
