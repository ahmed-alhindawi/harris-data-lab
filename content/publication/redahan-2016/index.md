  All rights reserved.Introduction and Aims: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common
  complication of critical illness. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is required in
  severe cases. There is considerable variability in the provision of renal support
  for critically ill patients. Current epidemiological data regarding the utilisation
  of RRT in critical care units in the UK is lacking. The aim of this study was twofold:
  to provide population-based data regarding the utilisation of RRT in critically
  ill patients and to examine variation in its use.Methods: Using the Intensive Care
  National Audit &amp; Research Centre (ICNARC) Case Mix Programme, we extracted data
  on consecutive admissions to adult, general critical care units in England, Northern
  Ireland &amp; Wales from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. Patients with a known
  history of dialysis dependence, chronic kidney disease or kidney.'
