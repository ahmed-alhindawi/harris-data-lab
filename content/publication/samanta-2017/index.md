abstract: Introduction The benefits of lung protective ventilation have been replicated
  in multiple trials.1,2 However, we suspected that adherence to this standard of
  care remained poor. Using the NIHR critical care Health Informatics Collaborative
  (ccHIC) database, we analysed data from 11 teaching hospital intensive care units
  (22 524 patient episodes) to investigate real-world clinical practice. Methods 1248
  patient episodes, where ventilation was continued for ≥48 hours, with 232,600 hours
  of concurrent mechanical ventilation and blood gas data were identified as suitable
  for analysis. Short gaps in ventilation (<6 hours) were imputed based on the median
  of nearest known values, and only the single longest period of ventilation from
  each patient episode was analysed. Results The median tidal volume received by patients
  was 7.3 ml/kg-1 PBW (IQR:5.7–8.8). Female patients, especially those with higher
  BMI (≥30 kgm-2) consistently received higher tidal volumes than males. Patients
  with severe respiratory failure (PaO2:FiO2 <13 kPa) received a median tidal volume
  of 7.1 ml/kg-1 PBW, and had 71% ICU mortality (Table 1). Patients with respiratory
  failure sufficient to qualify for recruitment into recent clinical trials (PaO2:FiO2
  <20 kPa with PEEP ≥5 cm/H20), who were exposed to tidal volumes≥12 ml/kg-1 PBW for
  longer than two hours had significantly increased risk of ICU mortality (odds ratio=2.89
  [1.25–7.2]; p=0.007); This was not observed for patients with PaO2:FiO2 ≥40 kPa
  (odds ratio=0.95 [0.58–1.56], p=0.91). Conclusions More than 15 years after the
  ARMA study1 demonstrated a mortality benefit from lung protective ventilation, we
  are still not implementing 6 ml/kg-1 PBW ventilation into clinical practice, and
  are exposing even patients with a severe respiratory failure (PaO2:FiO2 <13 kPa)
  to higher than recommended tidal volumes, with females and higher BMI patients at
  particular risk. We have also demonstrated that failure to institute lung protective
  ventilation in patients with a PaO2:FiO2 <20 kPa leads to increased ICU mortality,
  which is not present in patients with PaO2:FiO2 ≥40 kPa. ReferencesARDS Network.
