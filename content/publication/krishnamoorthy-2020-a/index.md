abstract: Graphical models have emerged as a tool to map out the interplay between
  multiple measured and unmeasured variables, and can help strengthen the case for
  a causal association between exposures and outcomes in observational studies. In
  Part 1 of this methods series, we will introduce the reader to graphical models
  for causal inference in perioperative medicine, and set the framework for Part 2
  of the series involving advanced methods for causal inference.
