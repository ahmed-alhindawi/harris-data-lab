abstract: Advances in technology are improving the quality and quantity of data available
  in ICU, creating opportunities for the development of patient-specific predictive
  models to support clinical decision-making. The 2012 PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology
  Challenge is to develop a patient-specific model for predicting in-hospital mortality
  using data collected during the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. Our approach was
  to develop an algorithm incorporating an artificial neural network trained on features
  extracted from the patient data. We explored the stability of vital signs such as
  heart rate and blood pressure with a method previously used to detect frequency
  and intensity of solar `nanoflaresâ€™. The ability of the resulting model to predict
  outcomes of patients was evaluated. The model was most successful in Event 2 of
  the Challenge, receiving a score of 22.83 for Set B and 38.23 for Set C. For the
  model to be clinically useful and to improve on existing scoring systems such as
  SAPS, further work is needed.
