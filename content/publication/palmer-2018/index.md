abstract: 'We conducted a 5-year retrospective cohort study on women undergoing caesarean
  section to investigate factors influencing the operating room-to-incision interval.
  Time-to-event analysis was performed for category-1 caesarean section using a Cox
  proportional hazards regression model. Covariates included: anaesthetic technique;
  body mass index; age; parity; time of delivery; and gestational age. Binary logistic
  regression was performed for 5-min Apgar score ≥ 7. There were 677 women who underwent
  category-1 caesarean section and who met the entry criteria. Unadjusted median (IQR
  [range]) operating room-to-incision intervals were: epidural top-up 11 (7-17 [0-87])
  min; general anaesthesia 6 (4-11 [0-69]) min; spinal 13 (10-20 [0-83]) min; and
  combined spinal-epidural 24 (13-35 [0-75]) min. Cox regression showed general anaesthesia
  to be the most rapid method with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.97 (1.60-2.44; p < 0.0001),
  followed by epidural top-up (reference group), spinal anaesthesia 0.79 (0.65-0.96;
  p = 0.02) and combined spinal-epidural 0.48 (0.35-0.67; p < 0.0001). Underweight
  and overweight body mass indexes were associated with longer operating room-to-incision
  intervals. General anaesthesia was associated with fewer 5-min Apgar scores ≥ 7
  with an odds ratio (95%CI) of 0.28 (0.11-0.68; p < 0.01). There was no difference
  in neonatal outcomes between the first and fifth quintiles for operating room-to-incision
  intervals. General anaesthesia is associated with the most rapid operating room-to-incision
  interval for category-1 caesarean section, but is also associated with worse short
  term neonatal outcomes. Longer operating room-to-incision intervals were not associated
  with worse neonatal outcomes.'
