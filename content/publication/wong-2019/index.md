abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Decisions to admit high-risk postoperative patients to critical
  care may be affected by resource availability. We aimed to quantify adult ICU/high-dependency
  unit (ICU/HDU) capacity in hospitals from the UK, Australia, and New Zealand (NZ),
  and to identify and describe additional ‘high-acuity’ beds capable of managing high-risk
  patients outside the ICU/HDU environment. METHODS: We used a modified Delphi consensus
  method to design a survey that was disseminated via investigator networks in the
  UK, Australia, and NZ. Hospital- and ward-level data were collected, including bed
  numbers, tertiary services offered, presence of an emergency department, ward staffing
  levels, and the availability of critical care facilities. RESULTS: We received responses
  from 257 UK (response rate: 97.7%), 35 Australian (response rate: 32.7%), and 17
  NZ (response rate: 94.4%) hospitals (total 309). Of these hospitals, 91.6% reported
  on-site ICU or HDU facilities. UK hospitals reported fewer critical care beds per
  100 hospital beds (median=2.7) compared with Australia (median=3.7) and NZ (median=3.5).
  Additionally, 31.1% of hospitals reported having high-acuity beds to which high-risk
  patients were admitted for postoperative management, in addition to standard ICU/HDU
  facilities. The estimated numbers of critical care beds per 100 000 population were
  9.3, 14.1, and 9.1 in the UK, Australia, and NZ, respectively. The estimated per
  capita high-acuity bed capacities per 100 000 population were 1.2, 3.8, and 6.4
  in the UK, Australia, and NZ, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative critical
  care resources differ in the UK, Australia, and NZ. High-acuity beds may have developed
  to augment the capacity to deliver postoperative critical care.'
