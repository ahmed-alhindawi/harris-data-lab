abstract: '<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An Informatics Consult has been
  proposed in which clinicians request novel evidence from large scale health data
  resources, tailored to the treatment of a specific patient, with return of results
  in clinical timescales. However, the availability of such consultations is lacking.
  We seek to provide an Informatics Consult for a situation where a treatment indication
  and contraindication coexist in the same patient, i.e., anti-coagulation use for
  stroke prevention in a patient with both atrial fibrillation (AF) and liver cirrhosis.
  We examined four sources of evidence for the effect of warfarin on stroke risk (efficacy)
  or all-cause mortality (safety) from: (i) randomised controlled trials (RCTs), (ii)
  meta- analysis of prior observational studies, (iii) trial emulation (using population
  electronic health records (N = 3,854,710) and (iv) genetic evidence (Mendelian randomisation).
  We developed prototype forms to request an Informatics Consult and return of results
  in electronic health record systems. We found 0 RCT reports and 0 trials recruiting
  for patients with AF and cirrhosis. We found broad concordance across the three
  new sources of evidence we generated. Meta-analysis of prior observational studies
  showed that warfarin use was associated with lower stroke risk (hazard ratio [HR]
  = 0.71). In a target trial emulation, warfarin was associated with lower all-cause
  mortality (HR = 0.61) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 0.27). Mendelian randomisation
  served as a drug target validation where we found that lower levels of vitamin K1
  (warfarin is a vitamin K1 antagonist) are associated with lower stroke risk. A pilot
  survey with an independent sample of 34 clinicians revealed that 85% of clinicians
  found information on prognosis useful and that 79% thought that they should have
  access to the Informatics Consult as a service within their healthcare systems.
  We identified candidate steps for automation to scale evidence generation and to
  accelerate the return of results within clinical timescales.</jats:p'
