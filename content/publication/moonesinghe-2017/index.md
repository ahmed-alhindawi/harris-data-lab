abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The admission of high-risk patients to critical care after
  surgery is a recommended standard of care. Nevertheless, poor compliance against
  this recommendation has been repeatedly demonstrated in large epidemiological studies.
  It is unclear whether this is due to reasons of capacity, equipoise, poor quality
  clinical care or because hospitals are working creatively to create capacity for
  augmented care on normal surgical wards. The EPIdemiology of Critical Care after
  Surgery study aims to address these uncertainties. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: One-week
  observational cohort study in the UK and Australasia. All patients undergoing inpatient
  (overnight stay) surgery will be included. All will have prospective data collection
  on risk factors, surgical procedure and postoperative outcomes including the primary
  outcome of morbidity (measured using the Postoperative Morbidity Survey on day 7
  after surgery) and secondary outcomes including length of stay and mortality. Data
  will also be collected on critical care referral and admission, surgical cancellations
  and critical care occupancy. The epidemiology of patient characteristics, processes
  and outcomes will be described. Inferential techniques (multilevel multivariable
  regression, propensity score matching and instrumental variable analysis) will be
  used to evaluate the relationship between critical care admission and postoperative
  outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethical approval from
  the National Research Ethics Service in the UK and equivalent in Australasia. The
  collection of patient identifiable data without prior consent has been approved
  by the Confidentiality Advisory Group (England and Wales) and the Public Privacy
  and Patient Benefit Panel (Scotland). In these countries, patient identifiable data
  will be used to link prospectively collected data with national registers of death
  and inpatient administrative data. The study findings will be disseminated using
  a multimedia approach with the support of our lay collaborators, to patients, public,
  policy-makers, clinical and academic audiences.'
